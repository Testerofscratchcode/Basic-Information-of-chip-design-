This is basic information about chip design.

Lecture 1:- Introduction To Basic Physics and Electricity  

There are two types of energy :
•	Potential energy is a stored form of energy. For example, water stored in a dam.
•	Kinetic Energy is a moving form of energy. For example, moving water in rivers.
In terms of electricity, we use voltage for stored energy and ampers for moving energy (current).
We use symbol (V) for voltage and (A) for amperes.

Mobile or laptop battery charging 
•	We are now aware that the electricity used to charge the computer's battery is potential energy that can be utilized later. 

•	Kinetic energy is the process by which energy in the battery used to power the laptop is converted. 

•	During the whole process kinetic energy to potential energy and back again Kinetic energy.

What is the requirement for this conversion ?

Ans : to convert the potential energy to kinetic energy you need :
•	A Path to flow the energy 
•	Example: Height A water tank on top of a building has more potential than a tank on the ground (an example from the video).
